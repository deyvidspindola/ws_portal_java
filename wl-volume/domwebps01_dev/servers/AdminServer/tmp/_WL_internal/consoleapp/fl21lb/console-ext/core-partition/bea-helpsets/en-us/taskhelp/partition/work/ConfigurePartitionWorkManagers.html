      thread usage policy among partitions. You can configure them to limit
      the number of Work Manager threads in each partition, as well as to
      manage thread usage allocation based on thread usage time for each
      partition. The importantance of regulating the relative thread usage is
      to provide proper quality of service (QoS) and fairness among various
      partitions that share the same WLS instance. Without it, a rogue
      application from one partition could starve thread resources from other
      partitions preventing them from functioning properly.</p>

      <p><a name="WLACH61001__startstop1198902" id="WLACH61001__startstop1198902"></a>To configure a Partition
      Work Manager:</p>
    </div>

    <ol><li>If you have not already done so, in the Change Center of the Administration Console, click <b>Lock &amp; Edit</b> (see <a href="/consolehelp/console-help.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=page&helpId=console.UseTheChangeCenter">Use the Change Center</a>).</li>

        <span><a name="WLACH61001__startstop1198904" id="WLACH61001__startstop1198904"></a>In the left
        pane of the Console, expand <b>Domain Partitions</b>
        and select <b>Partition Work Managers</b>.</span>

         
          <p>The Partition Work Managers table displays the defined Partition
          Work Managers.</p>
        
      </li>

      <li>
        <span><a name="WLACH61001__startstop1213516" id="WLACH61001__startstop1213516"></a>Click on the
        name of the Partition Work Manager you want to configure.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span><a name="WLACH61001__startstop1204881" id="WLACH61001__startstop1204881"></a>On the Edit
        Partition Work Manager page:</span>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <span>In the <b>Shared Capacity</b> field, enter a
            number between 1 and 100.</span>

             
              <p>The partition-shared capacity for Work Managers limit the
              number of work requests from a partition. This limit includes
              work requests that are either running or queued waiting for an
              available thread. When the limit is exceeded, WLS will start
              rejecting certain requests submitted from the partition.</p>

              <p>The value is expressed as a percentage of the capacity of the
              entire WLS Server as configured in the "Shared Capacity For Work
              Managers" option that throttles the number of requests in the
              entire WLS Server instance. The partition-shared capacity for
              Work Managers must be a value between 1 and 100 percent.</p>
            
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>In the <b>Fair Share</b> field, enter a
            number between 1 and 99.</span>

             
              <p>The fair share value is a desired percentage of thread usage
              of that partition compared to the thread usage of all
              partitions. The value must be a number between 1 and 99. Oracle
              recommends that the sum of this value for all partitions running
              in a WLS domain add up to 100. By default, a partition has a
              fair share value of 50.</p>
            
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>(Optional) Specify a <b>Minimum Threads
            Constraint</b> value.</span>

             
              <p>A minimum threads constraint guarantees a number of threads
              the server will allocate to a Work Manager to avoid deadlocks.
              This could result in a Work Manager receiving more thread use
              time than its configured fair share, and thus, a partition
              getting more thread usage time than it should compared to other
              partitions in the same WLS server instance.</p>

              <p>You can optionally provide a limit on the minimum threads
              constraint value for each partition configured in the WLS
              domain. If configured, this imposes an upper limit on the
              minimum threads constraint values configured in a partition. If
              the sum of the configured values of all minimum threads
              constraints in a partition exceeds this configured value, a
              warning message will be logged and WLS will reduce the number of
              threads the thread pool will allocate for the constraints.</p>

              <p>By default, no minimum threads constraint limit is set on a
              partition.</p>
            
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>(Optional) Specify a <b>Maximum Threads
            Constraint</b> value, the maximum number of threads in the
            self-tuning thread pool that are concurrently working on requests
            from a partition.</span>

             
              <p>A maximum threads constraint can be useful to prevent a
              partition from using more than its fair share of thread
              resources, especially in abnormal situations such as when
              threads are blocked on I/O, waiting for responses from a remote
              server that is not responding. Setting a maximum threads
              constraint in such a scenario would help ensure that some
              threads would be available for processing requests from other
              partitions in the WLS instance.</p>
